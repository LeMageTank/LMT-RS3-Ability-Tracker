Enter the keybinds for your action bars. Select the modifier for the keybind using the drop-down menu on the right, and enter the main key on the left. For non-alphanumeric keys including f keys, enter the keycode (f1 for f1, f2 for f2, del for delete, etc.).

An action bar cooresponding to each active action bar you selected on the action bar selection page will be shown. Each action bar and the continue dialogue can be moved by clicking and dragging (Drag the action bars by their opaque areas, transparent areas can be clicked-through). Drag the action bars to as closely as possible align with your in-game action bars. Right click action bars to change their layout.
